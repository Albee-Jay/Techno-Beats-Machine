### This is a Techno Beats Machine

[Click here to see it live](https://albee-jay.github.io/Techno-Beats-Machine/)

This is one of the test projects for the Free Code Camp's Front End Libraries curriculum.

I don't know why the repository says this is 100% HTML, because it isn't ... I used some JavaScript too, shooooo! Lol

I welcome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better. Thank You, Albee-Jay.
